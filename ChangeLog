                correctly.
0.7.5         - Added Greg Kuchyt's knock_add script but updated to be a

              - Patches from Christos Triantafyllidis
                - Updated FSF address.
0.7.2         - Patches from Paul Rogers
                - Applied missing fixes from issue #16 - OpenBSD build
                  issues, reordering of headers, scoping DLT_LINUX_SLL for
                  Linux only, for -> while loop in sniff() cleanup.
0.7.1         - Patches from Paul Rogers
                - Fixed issue #2 - SIGHUP (reload) now listens for new
                  sequences in the config file.
                - Fixed issue #26 - knockd now fails if a malformed config
                  file is read during SIGHUP (reload).
0.7           - Patches from Oswald Buddenhagen:
                - Document the 'target' configuration directive.
                - Merging OS-specific networking code to reduce LOCs and the
                  sea of #ifdefs.
              - Added 50ms timeout to pcap_open_live() to reduce CPU usage
                on network-heavy hosts. Pcap recommends we not use zero.
0.6           - Patches from Oswald Buddenhagen:
                - Cleanup: Don't null-check before free
                - Cleanup: Consolidate flag-check logic
                - Accept single-knock sequences
                - Introduce a 'target' configuration directive, enabling
                  knockd to react to connect attempts to a target host.
                  Useful in cases where knockd is on a router and you want
                  to send a target a wakeup packet.
0.5           - Added ability to change the knocking protocol (TCP/UDP) on a
                per-port basis using the knock client (instead of the -u
                switch)
              - Patches from Philippe Lovis <philippe.lovis@gmx.ch>:
                - Fixed memory leaks and potential security vulnerabilities
                - Added --lookup option for DNS lookups (default is off)
                - Added support for one-time sequences
                - Added Interface directive to select the listening interface
                - Moved packet filtering to kernel space with BPF filters
                - Support for excluding TCP flags with "!"
                - Removed the leftover/deprecated layer-2 MAC logic
0.4           - Added support for DLT_RAW (PPPoE) interfaces
              - Changed packet inspection to use the interface's IP address
                to determine the flow direction, rather than the ethernet
                MAC address
              - Changed logging date format to ISO (yyyy-mm-dd)
              - Added hostnames to logging output
0.3.1         - Fixed a segfault occurring when a hostname cannot be resolved
              - Patch from Simon Matter <simon.matter@ch.sauter-bc.com>:
                - fixes build errors on Fedora
              - Patch from Per Cederberg <per@percederberg.net>:
                - fixes TCP SYN timeouts in knock client
0.3           - Added PPP (LINUX_SLL) support
              - Patches from Leo Costela:
                - added Start_Command, Stop_Command, Cmd_Timeout directives,
                  allowing a single door to open and then close after a
                  timeout period
                - knockd now re-reads config when a HUP is received
                - multiple protocols supported on a per-port basis
0.2.1         - Bugfix for TCP flag discrimination
0.2           - Fixed the zombie process problem
              - Added patch from Leo Costela:
                - PidFile configuration directive
                - support for specific TCP flags
