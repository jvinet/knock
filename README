knock :: A port-knocking implementation

  ABOUT  
=========
This is a port-knocking server/client.  Port-knocking is a method where a
server can sniff one of its interfaces for a special "knock" sequence of
port-hits.  When detected, it will run a specified event bound to that port
knock sequence.  These port-hits need not be on open ports, since we use
libpcap to sniff the raw interface traffic.

===========
  EXAMPLE  
===========
The example below could be used to run a strict (DENY policy) firewall that
can only be accessed after a successful knock sequence.

1) Client sends four TCP SYN packets to Server, at the following ports:
      38281, 29374, 4921, 54918

2) Server detects this and runs an iptables command to open port 22 to Client.

3) Client connects to Server via SSH and does whatever it needs to do.

4) Client sends four more TCP SYN packets to Server:
      37281, 8529, 40127, 10100

5) Server detects this and runs another iptables to close port 22 to Client.

  KNOCKING CLIENTS
====================
The accompanying knock client is very basic.  If you want to more advanced
knocks (eg, setting specific tcp flags) then you should take look at hping,
sendip or packit.
