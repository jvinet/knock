.SH NAME
knockd \- port-knock server
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBknockd [options]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBknockd\fP is a \fIport-knock\fP server.  It listens to all traffic on
an ethernet (or PPP) interface, looking for special "knock" sequences of port-hits.
A client makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a
port on the server.  This port need not be open -- since knockd listens
at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic even if it's destined for a
closed port.  When the server detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it
runs a command defined in its configuration file.  This can be used to open
up holes in a firewall for quick access.
.SH COMMANDLINE OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-i, \-\-interface <int>"
Specify an interface to listen on.  The default is \fIeth0\fP.
.TP
.B "\-d, \-\-daemon"
Become a daemon.  This is usually desired for normal server-like operation.
.TP
.B "\-c, \-\-config <file>"
Specify an alternate location for the config file.  Default is
\fI/etc/knockd.conf\fP.
.TP
.B "\-D, \-\-debug"
Output debugging messages.
.TP
.B "\-l, \-\-lookup"
Lookup DNS names for log entries. This may be a security risk! See section
\fBSECURITY NOTES\fP.
.TP
.B "\-4, \-\-only-ip-v4"
Ignore packets from IPv6 and handle only IPv4.
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-verbose"
Output verbose status messages.
.TP
.B "\-V, \-\-version"
Display the version.
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Syntax help.
.SH CONFIGURATION
knockd reads all knock/event sets from a configuration file.  Each knock/event
begins with a title marker, in the form \fB[name]\fP, where \fIname\fP is the
name of the event that will appear in the log.  A special marker, \fB[options]\fP,
is used to define global options.
.TP
.SH Example #1:
.RS
This example uses two knocks.  The first will allow the knocker to access port
22 (SSH), and the second will close the port when the knocker is complete.
As you can see, this could be useful if you run a very restrictive (DENY policy)
firewall and would like to access it discreetly.

.TP
.SH Example #2:
.RS
This example uses a single knock to control access to port 22 (SSH).  After receiving
a successful knock, the daemon will run the \fBstart_command\fP, wait for the time
specified in \fBcmd_timeout\fP, then execute the \fBstop_command\fP.  This is useful
to automatically close the door behind a knocker.  The knock sequence uses both UDP
and TCP ports.

	sequence      = 2222:udp,3333:tcp,4444:udp

	cmd_timeout   = 5
	stop_command  = /usr/sbin/iptables \-D INPUT \-s %IP% \-p tcp \-\-syn \-j ACCEPT

.fi
.RE
.TP
.SH Example #3:
.RS
This example doesn't use a single, fixed knock sequence to trigger an event,
but a set of sequences taken from a sequence file (one time sequences),
specified by the \fBone_time_sequences\fP directive.  After each successful
knock, the used sequence will be invalidated and the next sequence from the
sequence file has to be used for a successful knock.  This prevents an attacker
from doing a replay attack after having discovered a sequence (eg, while
sniffing the network).

Example to support IPv4 and IPv6. You can provide a dedicated command for each
of the two protocols.

.SH CONFIGURATION: GLOBAL DIRECTIVES
.TP
.B "UseSyslog"
Log action messages through syslog().  This will insert log entries into your
/var/log/messages or equivalent.
.TP
.B "LogFile = /path/to/file"
Log actions directly to a file, usually /var/log/knockd.log.
.TP
.B "PidFile = /path/to/file"
Pidfile to use when in daemon mode, default: /var/run/knockd.pid.
.TP
.B "Interface = <interface_name>"
Network interface to listen on. Only its name has to be given, not the path to
the device (eg, "eth0" and not "/dev/eth0"). Default: eth0.
.SH CONFIGURATION: KNOCK/EVENT DIRECTIVES
.TP
.B "Sequence = <port1>[:<tcp|udp>],<port2>[:<tcp|udp>][,<port3>[:<tcp|udp>] ...]"
Specify the sequence of ports in the special knock. If a wrong port with
the same flags is received, the knock is discarded.  Optionally, you can
define the protocol to be used on a per-port basis (default is TCP).
.TP
.B "One_Time_Sequences = /path/to/one_time_sequences_file"
File containing the one time sequences to be used.  Instead of using a fixed
sequence, knockd will read the sequence to be used from that file.  After each
successful knock attempt this sequence will be disabled by writing a '#'
character at the first position of the line containing the used sequence.  That
used sequence will then be replaced by the next valid sequence from the file.

Because the first character is replaced by a '#', it is recommended that you
leave a space at the beginning of each line.  Otherwise the first digit in
your knock sequence will be overwritten with a '#' after it has been used.

Each line in the one time sequences file contains exactly one sequence and has
the same format as the one for the \fBSequence\fP directive.  Lines beginning
with a '#' character will be ignored.

\fBNote\fP: Do not edit the file while knockd is running!
.TP
.B "Seq_Timeout = <timeout>"
Time to wait for a sequence to complete in seconds. If the time elapses
before the knock is complete, it is discarded.
.TP
.B "TCPFlags = fin|syn|rst|psh|ack|urg"
Only pay attention to packets that have this flag set.  When using TCP flags,
knockd will IGNORE tcp packets that don't match the flags.  This is different
than the normal behavior, where an incorrect packet would invalidate the entire
knock, forcing the client to start over.  Using "TCPFlags = syn" is useful if
you are testing over an SSH connection, as the SSH traffic will usually
interfere with (and thus invalidate) the knock.

Separate multiple flags with commas (eg, TCPFlags = syn,ack,urg).  Flags can be
explicitly excluded by a "!" (eg, TCPFlags = syn,!ack).
.TP
.B "Target = <ip-address>"
Use the specified IP address instead of the address determined for the
\fBInterface\fP when matching the \fBSequence\fP.
This is useful if knockd is running on a router and you want to do something
in response to an actual connection attempt to a routed host - e.g., invoking
etherwake to send the host a WOL packet.
.TP
.B "Start_Command = <command>"
Specify the command to be executed when a client makes the correct
port-knock with IPv4.  All instances of \fB%IP%\fP will be replaced with the
knocker's IP address.  The \fBCommand\fP directive is an alias for
\fBStart_Command\fP.
.TP
.B "Start_Command_6 = <command>"
Specify the command to be executed when a client makes the correct
port-knock with IPv6.  All instances of \fB%IP%\fP will be replaced with the
knocker's IP address.  The \fBCommand_6\fP directive is an alias for
\fBStart_Command_6\fP. If not present it will automatically fallback onto
the same IPV4 \fBStart_Command\fP value. You can use empty value to force
doing nothing.
.TP
.B "Cmd_Timeout = <timeout>"
Time to wait (in seconds) between \fBStart_Command\fP and \fBStop_Command\fP.
This directive is optional, only required if \fBStop_Command\fP is used.
.TP
.B "Stop_Command = <command>"
Specify the command to be executed when \fBCmd_Timeout\fP seconds have passed 
since \fBStart_Command\fP has been executed.  All instances of \fB%IP%\fP will
be replaced with the knocker's IP address.  This directive is optional.
.TP
.B "Stop_Command_6 = <command>"
Specify the command to be executed when \fBCmd_Timeout\fP seconds have passed 
since \fBStart_Command_6\fP has been executed.  All instances of \fB%IP%\fP will
be replaced with the knocker's IP address.  This directive is optional.
If not present it will automatically fallback onto the same IPV4 
\fBStop_Command\fP value. You can use empty value to force
doing nothing.
.SH SECURITY NOTES 
Using the \fB-l\fP or \fB--lookup\fP commandline option to resolve DNS names
for log entries may be a security risk!  An attacker may find out the first port
of a sequence if he can monitor the DNS traffic of the host running knockd.
Also a host supposed to be stealth (eg, dropping packets to closed TCP ports
instead of replying with an ACK+RST packet) may give itself away by resolving a
DNS name if an attacker manages to hit the first (unknown) port of a sequence.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBknock\fP is the accompanying port-knock client, though \fBtelnet\fP or
\fBnetcat\fP could be used for simple TCP knocks instead.
For more advanced knocks, see \fBhping\fP, \fBsendip\fP or \fBpackit\fP.
